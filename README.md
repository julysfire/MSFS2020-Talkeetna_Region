##### Summary

This is a pack of airports in the Talkeetna, Alaska area.  Some of the airports were missing and have now been added, some airports were not in good condition from the auto generated area and height maps.  The surrounding water ways also suffered from this issue and were often very hilly and bumpy which made the shores look horrible as well.  This pack will address these issues while including one of the most intersting airports/airstrips I have encountered yet, 2AK7 - Bald Mountain Airstrip.  This is a small airstrip that is on top of a mountain with the runways ending in cliffs.  Have fun landing and taking off out of this airport!  This pack is perfect for some beautiful Alasakan VFR scenery.  I have worked on all these airports by hand in an effort to make realistic representations of each airports included.  All I ask is that you have fun and enjoy!

##### Note

- I noticed the first time I loaded the package, the water height was still messed up from a distance but upon getting closer to it, it fixed itself.  After reloading into the Sim, it doesn't do that.  If you see bad water height upon first loading in, try flying near it or reloading.


#### TODO

- Snow sticks to the TALKEETNA lettering, need to change that.

If you enjoyed it as well and would like to donate, it is very much appreciated but never will be required.  I am doing this to add to the community's total assets of airports and scenery and because honestly, I found I really enjoy doing this.  I only strive to make content that others can enjoy.
